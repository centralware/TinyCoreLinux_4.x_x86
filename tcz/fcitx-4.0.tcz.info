Comments:       This package = binary + pinyin data only
                fcitx-4.0.tcz supports following extension:
                
                For input method other than Pinyin,
                  install the corresponding data table.
                  for example: fcitx-4.0-table-wb.tcz
                For smarter phrase suggestion,
                  install fcitx-sunpunyin-xxx add-on (20M+)
                For missing skins
                  install fcitx-4.0-skin-ex
                For GUI based configuration tool
                  install fcitx-configtool-xxx 
                  note: for chinese interface install fcitx-4.0-locale
                        currently its Chinese interface doesn't work,
                        the author has already fixed this
                        waiting for his release update
                For fcitx-specific questions
