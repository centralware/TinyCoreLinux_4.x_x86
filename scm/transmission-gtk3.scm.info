Comments:	This app depends on a running instance of dbus.
		Including dbus is in the works for this package,
		But for now install dbus.tcz and start it:
		"/usr/local/etc.init.d/dbus start"
		
		This extension contains transmission-cli,
		transmission-daemon, and transmission-remote.
		There is a bug in this program that causes a 
		crash when trying to open a torrent without
		first opening and closing the Edit->Preferences
		window, open and close it first as a workaround:
