Comments:       Contains various scripts called mine-(lang-string).sh that if you create a file
		/home/tc/mine.txt and add one word per line, for words not found in your current dictionary
		then run 
		$ sh mine-(lang-string).sh
		The extra words then become available for spell checking thru the aspell command
		$ apell --lang=(lang-string) -c file

		Note lang-string is currently en, es, de, fi, fr, hu, it, pt_BR, ru
		eg $ sh mine-en.sh && aspell --lang=en -c filename

		This is not designed to be universal so your word list does not 
		have to be shared with others

		It is assumed your mine.txt will grow and can include names
