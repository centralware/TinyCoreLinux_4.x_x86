Comments:       From  http://www.luarocks.org/:

                  LuaRocks allows you to install Lua modules as
                  self-contained packages called "rocks", which also
                  contain version dependency information. This
                  information is used both during installation, so
                  that when one rock is requested all rocks it depends
                  on are installed as well, and at run time, so that
                  when a module is required, the correct version is
                  loaded. LuaRocks supports both local and remote
                  repositories, and multiple local rocks trees. You
                  can download and install LuaRocks on Unix and
                  Windows.

                -----------------------------------------------------

                See http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks/ for a list
                of available rocks.

                If you install a rock as a non-root user, the rock will
                be installed in $HOME/.luarocks, and you must include the
                LuaRocks loader to use it:

                  $ luarocks install bitlib
                  $ lua -l luarocks.loader -e 'bit = require"bit" ...'

                If you install a rock as root, the rock will be installed
                in /usr/local and will be available to all users without
                a special loader.

                  $ sudo luarocks install bitlib
                  $ lua -e 'bit = require"bit" ...'

                A full compilation environment is needed to build
                rocks, so this extension depends on the dependencies
                of compiletc.tcz.
