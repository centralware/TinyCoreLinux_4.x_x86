Tags:	    httptunnel creates bidirectional virtual data connection tunnelled HTTP requests.
Comments:       The HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired. This can be useful 
                for users behind restrictive firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through a HTTP proxy, 
                it's possible to use httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to a computer 
                outside the firewall.
