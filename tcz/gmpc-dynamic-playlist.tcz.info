Comments:       Adds similar songs/artists/genre to the play queue based on 
                last.fm data
                
                Will search for:
                * Similar Songs 
                * Similar Artists 
                * Similar Genres 
                with last.fm (used as metadata-plugin) or with genre-tag and add
                it to the playlist if there is no new song at the end of that
                playlist. If no similar song is found - a random one will be
                added.
