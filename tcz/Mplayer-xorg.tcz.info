Comments:       If you have unleashed the wrath of Xorg,
		here's the player to go with it. The darkest
		magicks available with this combo are XV,
		XVMC, XVIDIX, OpenGL, and other niceties
		to offload processing to your GPU.
-
		Depends on only Xorg. No GTK interface here.
-
		For sound you'll of course need OSS.
