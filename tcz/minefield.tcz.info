Comments:       A custom build of Firefox 3.0.4 for TC.
		Unlike the official Mozilla one, this does not
		depend on Xorg, and this also has a cooler icon ;)
-
		I modified the sources based on the Swiftfox patch;
		This build is fast.
-
		Customizations include dropping *all* unneeded cruft,
		like Gnome or D-bus support, updater, crash reporter.
		So there you have it, a light Icy Foxy.
