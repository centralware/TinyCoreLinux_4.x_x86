                gLabels is a program for creating labels and business cards.
                It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label
                and business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply
                stores.

                gLabels knows about a small universe of label/card stationery. 
                You may create new templates by using the Template Designer 
                under the File menu.
