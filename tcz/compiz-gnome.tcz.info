Comments:       This is OpenGL Desktop based on GNOME and Compiz.

		Before proceeding you need to setup hardware accelerated GLX (i.e. nvidia-glx, ati-fglrx)
		if you don't have it already.

		Installation:
		-------------------------------
		Step-1) Set root and tc/user password
			sudo passwd root
			sudo passwd tc
			# passwords can also be set by boot code "secure"
		Step-2) Install gconf schemas
			# Execute once
			sudo update-gconf-database register-all
		Step-3) Add to backup list (/opt/.filetool.lst)
			usr/local/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml
			etc/shadow
		Step-4) Open gconf-editor, go to desktop->gnome->session->required_components
		and set "windowmanager" key value to "compiz", This is graphical way. If you prefer command line:
		gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager --type=string compiz
		(don't run this as root)

		Note: If you have gnome-desktop-base setup already then skip Step-1 and Step-3 (do not skip Step-2 !)

		I have setup compiz with some plugins loaded by default
		and intentionally left all remaining plugin selection to you.

		You can select plugins with compizconfig settings manager (ccsm).

		My plugin recommendations:
		---------------------------------------
		Rotate Cube or Wall
		Ring Switcher or Shift Switcher
		Expo
		---------------------------------------

		Important note: Keybindings may not be working when you are just logged into X session.
		Restarting window manager solves this issue. You can restart compiz by executing the command "compiz".

		This extension requires Xorg.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
