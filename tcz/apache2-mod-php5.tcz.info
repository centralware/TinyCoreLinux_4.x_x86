Comments:	For use with apache2.tcz extension. This extension does not depend on php5.tcz, nor are they related.

		Usage: Install and restart your Apache Web Server. If your httpd.conf is not 
		in the default location, you have to add "Include conf/php5/mod_php5.conf" manually
		to your conf.

		Suhosin extension by Stefan Esser is included.
		Edit /usr/local/apache2/conf/php5/php.ini to your needs and add to backup.
		Do the same with the extension configuration files in /usr/local/apache2/conf/php5/extensions/.
	
		IMPORTANT: For some of the included extensions you need special additional libraries, 
		please take a look into dist.ini.
