Comments:       This extension installs your choice of
		Firefox and Flash.It does not contain Firefox
		or Flash. You download the version
		(and language) you wish to use from the internet, and
		put it into the tce directory, or put it in home, and
		use the  copy-from-home Application to copy the
		downloaded files from your home directory into tce.
		The newest versions found in tce will
		be used  (as determined by ls -rv).
		You don't need to have flash if you don't want to,
		this extension also works with Firefox only.
		You can switch versions quickly by simply replacing 
		the file(s)in tce and rebooting.
		This extension uses the files you have download
		and installs them "on the fly" on every boot.
		Works with Firefox 3.6 thru 8, flash 10 and 11
		Works with Firefox 9 thru 18.
