Comments:       Cdp-tools is a set of tools for working with the Cisco Discovery Protocol.
		They were written because of a particular hosting center that insisted on
		learning routes using CDP, and thusly required Cisco Switches for doing 
		their dirty work.
		
		cdp-listen/cdp-routemgr are proof-of-concepts that may be useful if you 
		want to implement a similarly brain-damaged proposal.

		cdp-send is a must-have tool if you are in that situation. It can pretend 
		to be just about any kind of Cisco hardware you can imagine.
