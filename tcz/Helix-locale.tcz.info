Comments:       Helix plays mp3/ogg/wav files and pls/m3u streams.
                It does not play RealAudio.
                -----------
                Because of licensing restrictions, Helix does not ship with
                an mp3 plugin. However this extension also contains the script
                "updatehelix". It will download the RealPlayer installer,
                extract its mp3 plugin and add it to your Helix extension.
                -----------
                The first time you run Helix, you must set the audio driver.
                Go to Tools > Preferences > Hardware and select ALSA or OSS.
                -------------
                You will also need wget.tcz if you want to run the optional 
                connection speed test.
                -------------
                To play streaming audio, just paste the URI into Open Location
