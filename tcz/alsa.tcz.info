                ----------
                This extension contains:
                alsa-lib-1.0.24.1 - LGPLv2.1 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/lib/alsa-lib-1.0.24.1.tar.bz2
                alsa-utils-1.0.24.2 - GPLv2 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/utils/alsa-utils-1.0.24.2.tar.bz2
                ----------
                Example howto:
                $ sudo alsaconf
                $ speaker-test -c2 -t wav -l1
                ----------
		Install the alsaconf.tcz extension if you need the alsaocnf
		scripot.
		To initialize alsa without having to use alsaconf, there is a
		script that will do that.  
		It can be placed in /opt/bootlocal.sh so it alsa will be setup 
		on boot with no user interaction required.  The command to do this is:

		/usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound start

		If adding this command to bootlocal.sh, you may need
		to precede it with the sleep command for it to be effective.

		If you want your alsa settings to persist across reboots, use the 
		command 'alsactl store' after alsa has been set up.  This stores the 
		configuration in /usr/local/etc/asound.state.  Place this file in your backup to 
		allow your alsa settings to persist across sessions.

		Additionally, if you first run alsaconf, the result of that will be used
		by /usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound instead of probing for and activating
		all the soundcards found on your system.  Only the card you selected in 
		alsaconf will be setup by alsasound upon later starting of alsasound once
		alsaconf is run.  To make this persist across reboots so alsasound does
		not have to be run in later sessions, back up these files/directories:

		opt/alsa
		etc/modprobe.conf

		Then add the command "/usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound start" in your
		/opt/bootlocal.sh file and your card should load on each boot as previously
		set up by alsaconf.
	
		ISA PnP support has been added to /usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound. 
		It will probe and insert modules for many known ISA PnP sound cards. 
		Also, an option to specify which kernel module for your ISA card is 
		there, just enter that/those names into /opt/alsa/.alsadriver, one on
		each line and only that module will be inserted without modprobing 
		unnecessary modules while trying to find your card.
