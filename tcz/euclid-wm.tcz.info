Comments:       default configuration files found in euclid-wm-doc.tcz
                copy to euclid-wm.conf and euclidrc into ~/.config/euclid-wm
                this wm is keyboard-driven so
                read manual page or conf file for keybindings
                wbar might not play nice, dzen and dmenu should.
