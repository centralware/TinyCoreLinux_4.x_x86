Comments:       From http://luajit.org/luajit.html:

                  LuaJIT implements the full set of language features
                  defined by Lua 5.1. The virtual machine (VM) is API-
                  and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter
                  and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.

                  LuaJIT offers more performance, at the expense of
                  portability. It currently runs on all popular
                  operating systems based on x86 or x64 CPUs (Linux,
                  Windows, OSX etc.) or embedded systems based on ARM
                  (Android, iOS) or PPC CPUs. Other platforms will be
                  supported in the future, based on user demand and
                  sponsoring.

                  ...

                  The FFI library allows calling external C functions
                  and using C data structures from pure Lua code.

                  The FFI library largely obviates the need to write
                  tedious manual Lua/C bindings in C. No need to learn
                  a separate binding language â€” it parses plain C
                  declarations! These can be cut-n-pasted from C
                  header files or reference manuals. It's up to the
                  task of binding large libraries without the need for
                  dealing with fragile binding generators.

                This extension contains the x86 version of the LuaJIT
                compiler. See the luajit-dev extension for the
                developmental files from the LuaJIT distribution.

                See the LuaJIT web site for extensive documentation.
