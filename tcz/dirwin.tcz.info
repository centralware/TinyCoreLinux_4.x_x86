Comments:	PPI compatible. 
		DirWin is a window that shows you the contents of one 
		directory and lets you perform certain functions on those 
		files.  DirWin uses the FLTK user interface library, which 
		makes it especially efficient on TinyCore Linux. The source  
		code of DirWin is released under the GNU license.  This file 
		manager features directory path input field; file command-line; 
		keyboard, menu, and drag-and-drop file manipulations;
		automatic configurable program associations; and more!
		Executable less than 55 KB.

		NOTE: Caution! This is a BETA-level software release and is for 
		careful testing by adventurous users only!  While care was taken 
		to eliminate bugs, this release likely still still contains 
		bugs and may crash and/or unintentional file deletion or 
		corruption.  Use at your own risk!  Thoughtful and detailed 
		feedback on bugs, usability issues, and improvement ideas is 
		appreciated.
