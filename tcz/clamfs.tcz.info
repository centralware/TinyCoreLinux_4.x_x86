Comments:       ClamFS is a FUSE-based user-space file system for Linux with on-access anti-virus file scanning 
through clamd daemon.

Features
- User-space file system (no kernel patches, recompilation, etc.)
- Configuration stored in XML files
- FUSE (and libfuse) used as file system back-end
- Scan files using ClamAV
- ScanCache (LRU with time-based and out-of-memory expiration) speeds up file access
- Sends mail to administrator when detect virus

HowTo

- Setup clamd.conf

Prep the clamd.conf file
$ cd /usr/local/etc/clamav
$ sudo rm -f clamd.conf
$ sudo cp /tmp/tcloop/clamav/usr/local/etc/clamav/clamd.conf .
$ echo "usr/local/etc/clamav/clamd.conf" >> /opt/.filetool.lst

Edit the clamd.conf file
Uncomment this line
#LocalSocket /tmp/clamd.socket
Save and exit clamd.conf file
 
Update virus definitions
$ freshclam
 
Start clamav daemon
$ clamd
 
If you want clamd to start onboot
$ echo "clamd" >> /opt/bootlocal.sh
 
Make the changes persistent
$ filetool.sh -b
 
- setup clamfs.xml
 
Create some folders, I'm doing this as the tc user.
$ cd /home/tc
$ mkdir public
$ mkdir .public
 
Prep the clamfs.xml file
$ cd /usr/local/etc/clamfs
$ sudo rm -f clamfs.xml
$ sudo cp /tmp/tcloop/clamfs/usr/local/etc/clamfs/clamfs.xml .
$ echo "usr/local/etc/clamfs/clamfs.xml" >> /opt/.filetool.lst
 
Edit the clamfs.xml file
 
Find this line
 <clamd socket="/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl" check="yes" />
Change it to this
 <clamd socket="/tmp/clamd.socket" check="yes" />
  
Find this line
 <filesystem root="/tmp" mountpoint="/clamfs/tmp" public="yes" />
Change it to this
 <filesystem root="/home/tc/.public" mountpoint="/home/tc/public" readonly="no" nonempty="yes" public="yes" />
     
Find this line
 <!-- <log method="file" filename="/var/log/clamfs.log" verbose="no" /> -->
Change it to this
 <log method="file" filename="/var/log/clamfs.log" verbose="no" />
      
Save and exit clamfs.xml
      
Start clamfs and mount your public folder
$ sudo clamfs clamfs.xml
      
- Test everything is working
      
$ cd /home/tc/public
      
Download the eicar test file with wget
$ tce-load -i wget
$ wget http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com
      
Performing any action on the file should result in an error, but you can delete the file.
      
Check the clamfs log file for entrys regarding the eicar test file
$ less /var/log/clamfs.log
      
A few notes:
- The public folders are only examples, use your folders as needed
- The default whitelist and blacklist entrys in clamfs.xml might need fine tuning, depending on what you want 
to monitor
- ClamFS does its thing once an infected file is in your file system and you try to access the file 
in some way, Clamfs does not stop an infected file form being saved to your file system in the first 
place. To quote a very helpful tinycore forum member "The cockroaches can get in, but they can't 
get out"
