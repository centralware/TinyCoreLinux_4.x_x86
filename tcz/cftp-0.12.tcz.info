Comments:	The advantage of cftp over standard FTP clients is its 
		full-screen presentation of the remote directory tree which 
		then can be navigated with arrow keys, etc.
		Supports FTP active/assive, IPv4 and IPv6 plus SFTP
		
		most basic command is cftp (site) ie cftp ibiblio.org
		
		cftp -h will print an overview of options.
		
		Also possible to tag (t) multiple files and get them all 
		at once (D)...get your tcz's downloaded wholesale
		
	        type :exit to quit cftp or
		     :help for command info.
