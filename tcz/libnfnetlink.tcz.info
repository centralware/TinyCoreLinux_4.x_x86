Comments:	libnfnetlink is the low-level library for netfilter
		related kernel/userspace communication. It provides a
		generic messaging infrastructure for in-kernel netfilter
		subsystems (such as nfnetlink_log, nfnetlink_queue,
		nfnetlink_conntrack) and their respective users and/or
		management tools in userspace. This library is not meant
		as a public API for application developers. It is only
		used by other netfilter.org projects, such as
		libnetfilter_log, libnetfilter_queue or
		libnetfilter_conntrack.
