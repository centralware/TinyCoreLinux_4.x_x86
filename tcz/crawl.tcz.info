Comments:	Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Tiles version

		Whit tiles version is essential to have
		installed Xorg (is better 3d version), i test
		with Xorg7.5 and 7.6, both work but to me
		the 7.6 crashes at the close of game.
		
		From my desk is important to launch crawl by menu
		and not by terminal or keyboard not works!
		
		Warning! the game crashes at the end of each chapter 
		of the tutorial, this does not affect any other part 
		of the game and you can do anyway the tutorial. 
		I opened a bug report, but in the meantime, the game 
		remains usable.

		The settings is in /usr/locale/share/crawl/
		tiles.options.txt , edit and store in your
		backup to change interface option.
			
		Is possible to install and play indifferently
		whit same saves the tiles and the console
		version.
			
		This extension is PPI compatible.
