Comments:       Peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency - daemon
		Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
		is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
		trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
		transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
		check for double-spending.

Change-log:     
		This is a maintenance release that adds a new network rule to avoid a chain-forking incompatibility with versions 0.7.2 and earlier.
Current:        2011/03/18
