                Suggests extra tcz(s): hddtemp.tcz, file.tcz, iproute2.tcz, lm_sensors.tcz, 
                module-init-tools.tcz, usbutils.tcz. inxi will only output extra info if
                the relevant files are installed. 
                Running "inxi --recommends" may give clues as to what inxi detects as 
                being installed 

                inxi is a fork of infobash by Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif

                Maintainer suggests run inxi -99 to set color defaults on first run, or -h 
                to see other options.
