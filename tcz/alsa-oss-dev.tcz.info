Comments:       One of the aims of ALSA is to provide full OSS compatibility for OSS applications.
		ALSA does this by emulating the old OSS sound driver.
		ALSA has two alternative methods of emulating the old OSS sound driver:
		* The first (and most reliable) emulation method is to load ALSA's kernel
			OSSEmulation modules: snd-pcm-oss, snd-mixer-oss, and snd-seq-oss.
   		* The second emulation method is to use the aoss script included in the alsa-oss package. 
		For example, to use the xmms media player program, which in some old version is only an
		OSS application, you can start it using aoss:
				aoss xmms
		together with the OSS output plugin of xmms.
		Usage of aoss is preferred over kernel-level OSS emulation because if you need use the
		PCM plugin layer, enabling the use of the DmixPlugin or asym.
		If you don't need software-mixing of streams or any other PCM layer functionality,
		then go with the kernel-level emu (modules), since they are much easier to set up:
		Just load them.
		For details of how to use the kernel modules see the OSSEmulation page.
		You can define PCM devices in the .asoundrc which will then get used by the aoss
		script (pcm.dsp0). See the man page of aoss. Also I think that you can tell it which mixer
		to use; use a "ctl.mixer0" entry for that.
		Important It seems that aoss does not support libc's fopen() function calls.
		So all OSS apps that use the sound devices by calling fopen() won't work with aoss.
		The sox program, for example, won't work. I don't know of any others though I suspect
		that there are quite a few.
		Teamspeak uses fopen() too in the current version. Teamspeak 3.x is supposed to have
		native ALSA support though. Maybe aoss will be adapted to catch calls to libc's fopen() 
		and other related functions.
