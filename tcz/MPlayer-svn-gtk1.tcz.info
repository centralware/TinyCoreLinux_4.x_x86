Comments:       This is the gtk1 build of Mplayer.
		This extension requires the gtk1.tce and glib1.tce
		extensions. Install either alsa.tcel or OSS.tcem for 
		sound.  It will play most known
		audio and video formats, as well DVDs without 	
		needing additional codecs or dependencies.  The 
		default codecs directory is /usr/local/codecs. Gtk1
		is the default interface when launched from the menu, 
		but Mplayer will play from the command line in a 
		terminal window or will even play at the console in 
		the framebuffer if you are logged out of X and have
		framebuffer enabled.  Some helpful hints:
		----------
		Videos cannot by default be scaled to fullscreen with 
		the X11 driver.  To be able to scale videos to full
		screen with the X11 driver, issue this command from a 
		terminal:
		$ mplayer -zoom f video.mpg
		But the XV driver is statically compiled and should
		work if Xorg is running.
		----------
		To make that annoying message about a subfont go away,
		symlink a .ttf font to ~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf.  If you
		have dejavu fonts installed and are in the /home/tc
		directory:
		$ ln -s /usr/local/share/fonts/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf .mplayer/subfont.ttf
		----------
		Create a link for your dvd drive.  If it is /dev/hdc:
		$ sudo ln -s /dev/hdc /dev/dvd
		----------
		You may need read access to the drive:
		$ sudo chmod 644 /dev/hdc
		----------
		To reduce jerkiness in DVD play, turn on dma acceleration
		for the dvd drive:
		$ sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc
		----------
		If you are planning to use Mplayer from the console
		(no X running) you need read/write access to the 
		framebuffer device:
		$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/fb0
		Booting with the vga=7xx option is the easiest way to
		enable the framebuffer.
		----------
		For audio cd's enter at the command line after making
		sure that /dev/cdrom points to your desired cd drive:
		mplayer cdda://
		----------	
		To access Windows media and some other formats, install the
		codecs from the Mplayer site.  Untar the .tar.bz2 package
		and copy the codec files to /usr/local/codecs.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
