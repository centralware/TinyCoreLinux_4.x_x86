		AbiWord 2.8 is a multi-platform, collaborative word processor that combines
		state-of-the-art usability, powerful features, and excellent interoperability.
		Furthermore, it features a powerful framework for supporting custom extensions
		and ability to run AbiWord in many languages.
		AbiWord allows you to collaborate with multiple people on one document at the
		same time. It is tightly integrated with the AbiCollab.net web service, which
		lets you store documents online, allows easy document sharing with your friends,
		and performs format conversions on the fly.
