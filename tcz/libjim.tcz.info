Comments:       From the website:
		Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming        
   		language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like          
     		references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented            
     		Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and       
           	UTF-8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending upon     
              	selected options).
              	
                This extension installs an interpreter as an embeddable library, use with headers.
