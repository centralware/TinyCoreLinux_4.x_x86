Comments:       inadyn by Joachim Nilsson is a fork of the original INADYN implementation
                from Narcis Ilisei. Most of the fixes and additions from the new "upstream"
                by Christoph Brill have been included.

                The original INADYN is a free DynDNS client. It gives the possibility to
                have your own fixed hostname registered on the internet, although your IP might 
                be changing. It checks periodically whether the IP address stored by the DNS
                server is the real current IP address of the machine that is running INADYN.

                Supports the following services:
                 dyndns.org (in all three flavors: dynamic, static, custom)
                 freedns.afraid.org
                 zoneedit.com
                 no-ip.com
                 sitelutions.com
                 dynsip.org
                 dnsomatic.com
                 dns.he.net
                 various services similar to dyndns (e.g. dyndns.it)

                - Maintains up multiple aliases of the same IP address.
                - Runs as a service.
                - Runs fine behind a router.
                - Or runs as a console application.
                - Does not perform unnecessary updates.
                - Has 'install and forget it feature'. 
                - That is, after install one can completely forget about it. 
                - No maintenance required.

                To start inadyn daemon on bootup just add it in your /opt/bootlocal.sh or ~/.profile:
                 inadyn -u username -p password -a host.dyndns.org --update_period 1800000 --background
