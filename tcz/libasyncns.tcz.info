Tags:		libasyncns tiny C library name service queries asynchronously
Comments:	libasyncns is an asynchronous wrapper around getaddrinfo(3),
		getnameinfo(3), res_query(3) and res_search(3) from libc and
		libresolv.
		It is very tiny, consisting of just one header and one source
		file. It has no dependencies besides libc.
