		Everything is installed into /opt/inspircd
		To run, copy conf/*.example to conf/* and edit configs.
		Then from /opt/inspircd run ./inspircd start
		
		The wiki found at http://wiki.inspircd.org/ has good
		documentation on configuration and running.
		
		Depends on perl5 and optionally on openssl or gnutls
