Comments:       Depends on libmowgli, libmcs, gtk2 and dependencies,
		libglade2, audacious.
		There is a much fuller list of depends depending on what
		audio format you are wanting to play.  I would rather not 
		include all of them taking up many megabytes for those who
		simply want to play mp3s.  Wavpack support would require 
		installing wavpack.tcz, and flac support would require installing
		flac.tcz, and etc.
