Title:          librsync.tcz 
Description:    librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote
                file synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility
                and is used in rproxy. This algorithm transfers the differences
                between 2 files without needing both files on the same system.

Comments:       librsync is a free software library that implements the rsync
                remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows efficient remote
                updates of a file, without requiring the old and new versions to
                both be present at the sending end. The library uses a "streaming"
                design similar to that of zlib with the aim of allowing it to be
                embedded into many different applications.
                librsync is currently pre-1.0, with most important functionality working.
                librsync is not wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, and is not likely
                to be in the future.
                This is a new codebase, designed to allow a fresh start on the problem
                and a cleaner design. It may be used in a future version of rsync or a 
                successor project. Early steps towards that are visible in Wayne's
                rZync prototype, and Martin's superlifter design.
                The librsync project was created by Martin Pool and is now being
                enhanced and finished by the folks you can find on the project page.
                The librsync algorithm is based on the well-known and trustworthy rsync
                software by Andrew Tridgell.
                PPI compatible.
