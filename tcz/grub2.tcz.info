		Be sure to not have any other versions of grub
		installed when using this one.
		For a basic usage, install this package and then
		issue this command if your boot device is /dev/hda
		and your boot directory is /mnt/hda2/boot:	
		------
		sudo grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt/hda2 /dev/hda
		------
		Then create a basic config file in /mnt/hda2/boot/grub/
		named grub.cfg. Below is one that would work with the above
		scenario assuming you have bzImage and tinycore.gz located
		in /mnt/hda2/boot:
		------
		##begin file
		menuentry "Tinycore 3" {
		linux /boot/bzImage quiet home=hda2 showapps
		initrd /boot/tinycore.gz
		}
		##end file
		------
		Refer to grub2 documentation for a more elaborate stetup
		or how to multiboot other OS's.  Also, a wiki page
		is located at http://wiki.tinycorelinux.com/gfx.
		There is presently no automatic grub setup as the 
		grub binaries need the / directory mounted to a device
		to work.  So manual grub.cfg creation is necessary at
		this time.
