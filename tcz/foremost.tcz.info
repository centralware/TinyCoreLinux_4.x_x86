Comments:       a program to recover files based on their headers and footers.
                Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd,
                Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers are
                specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and choose which
                headers you want to look for.
