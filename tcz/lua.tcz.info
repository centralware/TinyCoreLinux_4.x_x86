                  Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable 
                  scripting language.

		  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful
		  data description constructs based on associative
		  arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically
		  typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a
		  register-based virtual machine, and has automatic
		  memory management with incremental garbage collection,
		  making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
		  rapid prototyping.

                See http://www.lua.org/docs.html for documentation.  In
                particular, the "Lua 5.1 Reference Manual" is

                  http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/

                and "Programming in Lua" (first edition about Lua 5.0) is

                This extension was built from

                  http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.4.tar.gz

                using the 

                  MYCFLAGS="-DLUA_USE_POSIX -DLUA_USE_DLOPEN\
                   -DLUA_USE_READLINE -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe"
                  MYLIBS="-lm -Wl,-E -ldl -lreadline -lhistory -lncurses"
		  make CFLAGS="$MYCFLAGS" LIBS="$MYLIBS" generic

                This extension contains 

                * "lua", the Lua compiler / interpreter, and
                * "luac", the compiler part of "lua" that produces
                  byte code.

                Only "lua" is needed for scripting.  See lua-dev.tcz
                for the developmental files from the Lua distribution 
                and lua-doc.tcz for the documentation files.
