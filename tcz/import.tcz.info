Comments:       A console based tool to import Debian packages
                It will produce a directory of tcz and dependencies from accessing a
		Debian master index list.

		************************************************************************
		Warning: This will attempt to download the master index file.
		It is a 27MB file. Be sure that you have your tce directory setup
		on physical media!
		************************************************************************

		Subsequent use of import uses zsync to ensure the master index file
		remains current.

		Once tested, use the import flags to copy tczs to your regular tce 
		directory then removed the pacakge directory.
