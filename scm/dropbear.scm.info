Comments:       The dropbear package as found in TC 2.8rc1 and earlier.
		To start the server: /apps/dropbear/etc/init.d/dropbear start
		Contains:
		dropbear 	-	2012.55
		----
		Uses the same PID file as dropbear.tcz when run as
		a server - /var/run/dropbear.pid - so if one is running
		the other won't start and collide with it.
