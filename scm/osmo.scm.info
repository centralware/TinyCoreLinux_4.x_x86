Comments:       A TC menu item is included that pops up the Osmo calendar.
                ------------       
                On small screens, Osmo works better with tabs on the right side.
                See Options > General > Appearance
                -------------
                Osmo has printer support, but the layout may not match your printer.
                Here is a work-around:
                  1. Install epdfview-cups.tcz
                  2. In Osmo, use Print Preview. This opens the document in epdfview.
                  3. Print from epdfview using your CUPS settings.
