Comments:       TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files..
                ..by converting them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data..
                ..along with digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes..
                ..them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play sounds,
                but also can save the generated waveforms.
                ----------
                should play with alsa and oss
                ----------

		unison-soundfont.scm is the preconfigured sound font enabled
		in the /apps/timidity-basic/etc/timidity.cfg file.  Just install
		unison-soundfont.scm and then use timidity.  Otherwise:

		Install a soundfont package, edit /apps/timidity-basic/etc/timidity.cfg
		to match your installed soundfont extension, the file is commented 
		to make it simple.  Then add /apps/timidity-basic/etc/timidity.cfg
		to your backup for persistence across reboots.
		Available soundfont extensions at present:
		freepats.scm
		unison-soundfont.scm
		fluidr3gm-soundfont.scm
