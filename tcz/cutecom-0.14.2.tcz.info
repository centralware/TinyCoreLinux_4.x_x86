Comments:       Cutecom is a graphical serial terminal.
		It is aimed mainly at hardware developers or other people
		who need a terminal to talk to their devices.

		The latest version available is 0.22.0 but to build it
		against qt-4.5.3 qt3support is needed which is not avalaible in
		qt-4.5-devs.tcz extension. cutecom-0.14.2 is the latest to build
		with qt3.
