                See config file /usr/local/etc/gpm/gpm.conf to 
                set approprite settings.  Default settings work with
                ps2, usb, and my own touch screen keyboard mouse, but
                if for some reason that is not sufficient enter 
                appropriate values.  Start gpm with /usr/local/etc/init.d/gpm,
                which will read the above mentioned config file for 
                settings.
