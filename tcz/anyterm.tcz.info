Comments:       Anyterm is a combination of a web page and a process that runs on your web server that provides SSH or telnet access.

                How it works:
                 Anyterm consists of some Javascript on a web page, an XmlHttpRequest channel on standard ports back to the server, an HTTP proxy such as Apache's mod_proxy and the Anyterm daemon.
                 The daemon uses a pseudo-terminal to communicate with a shell or other application, and includes terminal emulation.
                 Key presses are picked up by the Javscript which sends them to the daemon; changes to the emulated screen are sent from the daemon to the Javascript which updates its display.
                 Performance is quite reasonable and SSL can be used to secure the connection.

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1

                Source modification (gcc>=4.4 fix):
                 #include <cstdio> added to libpbe/src/SmtpClient.cc

                Use the init.d script to control anytermd:
                 /usr/local/etc/init.d/anyterm start
                You can start anytermd manually (for debuging purposes):
                 ex.: anytermd --charset UTF-8 --port 7676 --local-only

                If bad characters are appearing (ex.: in Midnight Commander)
                then set your LANG and TERM environment variables:
                 TERM=linux and an UTF-8 supported LANG should be fine

                Create HTTP proxy: (Don't forget to add Authentication rules to protect the page)
                Apache example:
                  <Location /anyterm>
                   # When someone visits /anyterm they'll be proxied to Anyterm on port 7676.
                   ProxyPass http://localhost:7676 ttl=60
                   # There are various parameters that can appear at the end of the ProxyPass directive to control the maximum number of connections and so on. See the Apache documentation.
                   ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:7676
                  </Location>
                Cherokee example:
                 Reverse Proxy Request:
                  URL Rewriting:
                   RegEx: ^/anyterm/$
                    Substitution: /anyterm.html
                   RegEx: ^/anyterm/(.*)$
                    Substitution: /
