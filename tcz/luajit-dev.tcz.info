Comments:       From http://luajit.org/luajit.html:

                  LuaJIT implements the full set of language features
                  defined by Lua 5.1. The virtual machine (VM) is API-
                  and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter
                  and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.

                  LuaJIT offers more performance, at the expense of
                  portability. It currently runs on all popular
                  operating systems based on x86 or x64 CPUs (Linux,
                  Windows, OSX etc.) or embedded systems based on ARM
                  (Android, iOS) or PPC CPUs. Other platforms will be
                  supported in the future, based on user demand and
                  sponsoring.

                  ...

                  The FFI library allows calling external C functions
                  and using C data structures from pure Lua code.

                  The FFI library largely obviates the need to write
                  tedious manual Lua/C bindings in C. No need to learn
                  a separate binding language â€” it parses plain C
                  declarations! These can be cut-n-pasted from C
                  header files or reference manuals. It's up to the
                  task of binding large libraries without the need for
                  dealing with fragile binding generators.

                  http://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta9.tar.gz

                See the LuaJIT web site for extensive documentation.

                This extension contains the developmental files from
                the LuaJIT distribution.  See the luajit extension
                for the compiler.

                These files are needed if the comparable ones from 
                the lua extension are are not installed or if you 
                wish to link against the LuaJIT libraries.
