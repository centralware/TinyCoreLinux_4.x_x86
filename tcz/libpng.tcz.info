Comments:       libpng is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for over 15 years.

                TinyCore has this library by default, so you don't need it.
                If you are using MicroCore and you need for example libpng12.so.0 for PHP, then you should install this package.

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
