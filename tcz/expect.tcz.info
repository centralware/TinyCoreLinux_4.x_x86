Comments:       Expect automates interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. It is also useful for testing these same applications.
                Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively difficult with anything else.
                You will find that Expect is an absolutely invaluable tool - using it, you will be able to automate tasks that you've never even thought of before.
