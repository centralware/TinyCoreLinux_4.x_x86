Comments:	libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented
		to Netlink developers. There are a lot of common tasks
		in parsing, validating, constructing of both the Netlink
		header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get
		wrong. This library aims to provide simple helpers that
		allows you to re-use code and to avoid re-inventing
		the wheel.
