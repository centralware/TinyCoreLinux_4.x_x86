Comments:       light-weight system monitor for X, with more deps/features
                ----------
                Compiled to match xlibs in base, hence no double-buffering unless the..
                ..Xorg-7.x extension is used
                ----------
                also looks better if a fonts extension like ttf-bitstream-vera is used
                ----------
                Modify /usr/local/etc/conky/conky.conf to suit your taste
                ----------
                This extension contains:
                conky-1.8.1 - BSD/GPL - http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/conky/conky-1.8.1.tar.bz2
                ----------
