Comments:	This extension lacks 3D support and runs without Xorg. Steps:

			1. In winecfg under Graphics uncheck 'Allow window manager to control windows'
			2. wine myapp.exe
			3. Check out wine-gecko.tcz and/or winetricks.tcz to get browser support and/or winetricks.
			4. Example for winetricks.tcz:
				$ winetricks list-download
				$ winetricks corefonts

		For 3D, printing, scanning, ldap, etc. support use the wine-gl.tcz extension.
	   	--- 
		This extension is PPI compatible.
