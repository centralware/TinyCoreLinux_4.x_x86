Comments:       Cherokee is a lighweight, very fast, flexible and easy to configure Web Server.
                Its performance is comparable to nginx, with less RAM utilized under high load.

                It supports:
                FastCGI, SCGI, PHP, CGI, SSI, TLS and SSL encrypted connections, Virtual hosts, 
                Authentication, on the fly encoding, Load Balancing, Apache compatible log files, 
                Data Base Balancing, Reverse HTTP Proxy, Traffic Shaper and others.

                An optional user friendly interface called cherokee-admin is provided for a no-hassle 
                browser-based configuration of the server. The conf file can also be edited manually.
                Check out the benchmarks and documentation to learn more, and give it a try to
                squeeze your hardware to the fullest!
