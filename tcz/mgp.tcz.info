Comments:       Magicpoint is a presentation program similar to Powerpoint or OO 
		Impress. It differs from them though in that slides are created 
		as text instead of in a GUI.
-
		Features:
		- Content is written in text files and formatting is indicated 
		by text features. For example, different level bullet points can be 
		created by simply indenting the text with tabs
		- A talk timer and slide guide
		- Presentations can be exported to HTML or Postscript files.
		- Ability to draw on slides during a presentation :)
