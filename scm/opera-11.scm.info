		Check ~/.xsession and look for similar to 
		below, or adjust your xorg.conf for Xorg:
		Xvesa -br -screen 1024x768x24
		
		
                Since Opera has a low-ram mode where e-mail,
                IRC, and RSS functionality is removed, and
                because it's primarily a browser, the icon
                launches this low-ram mode. Both are available
                in the menu.
		Also works with flash if gtk2.scm and getFlash11.scm
		are used.
		Contains:
		expat -		version 2.0.1
		fontconfig - 	version 2.8.0
