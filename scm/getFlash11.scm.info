                Extracts linux libflashplayer.so
                Also includes compiled libflashsupport.so

                Finally packages a flash.scm to add to your scm collection.
		It is created in /tmp/getflash.tmp.4321 after running 
		/apps/bin/getflash11.sh.  Reaquires gtk2.scm to be loaded.
		
		TO SELECT PARTICULAR 11.X VERSION:
		
		Issue the command:
		getflash11.sh --available
		and that will list available versions. Then to select one of those:
		getflash11.sh VERSION=11.2.202.228
		will select your desired version.

		curl - version 7.21.7
		nss - version 3.12.11
