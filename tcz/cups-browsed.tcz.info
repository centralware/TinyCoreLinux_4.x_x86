Comments:       CUPS upstream has split into cups and cups-filters.

		cups-browsed is an executable to browse Bonjour broadcasts 
		of remote CUPS printers and makes those printers available.
		OPTIONAL bluez.tcz  

		Do NOT start cups with normal init please but use either:
		--"browsed" init, assumes you do not need to use bluetooth;
		--"2b" assumes you do.
		Run which ever fits your hardware needs
		$ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/browsed {start/stop/status/restart}
		$ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/2b {start/stop/status/restart}

		If one or more daemons are falling over, I suggest you do not
		use "restart" but stop them all and start again.

		** Persistence, add to your backup, the following line
		usr/local/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf (if you changed it)
		You may also need to change configs from cups.tcz
		** Some network users may need to create (using root powers) /usr/local/etc/cups/client.conf
		ServerName server-ip  eg ServerName 192.168.1.200
		Where server-ip would be replaced by the local IP address of the CUPS server on the network.
		Config is case sensitive, meaning watch out for ServerName. Most printers have different 
		settings pls read http://localhost:631/help/network.html

		Note that---the remote printer = target printer NEEDS to have
		printer shaing enabled for your print job to work.

		For those browsing Windows printer you may wish to read the samba section of
		http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:cups
		and a shorter config to read for samba users is
		http://www.maenad.net/geek/di8k-debian/node16.html

		** software firewall users might like to try
		$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 5353 -j ACCEPT
		I am not a security expert, try at own risk pls

		**TIP for extra trouble-shooting, instead of running $ /pathway/some-init status
		load htop and press F4 for filter search and type cups then type avahi
