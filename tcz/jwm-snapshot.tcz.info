Comments:       This is the newer jwm snapshot binary that supports
                more features then the original jwm extension, such 
                as rounded corners. It installs the executable to 
                /usr/local/bin/jwm which is before /usr/bin/jwm in 
                the $PATH. To revert to the original jwm binary just 
                uninstall this extension. This change from the 
                previous release is meant to simplify the process of
                keeping up with configuration changes to the original
                jwm extension.
