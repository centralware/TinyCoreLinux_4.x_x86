Comments:		PPI compatible. Upgrades the older versions of Fluff
				included in Tiny Core Linux 3.5 and 3.6 to the
				current version with bug fixes and a friendlier UI.
				Fluff is a fast, light utility for files.  Fluff uses 
				the FLTK user interface library, which makes it 
				especially efficient on Tiny Core Linux. The source code 
				of Fluff is released under the GNU license.  This file 
				manager features a directory tree and file details list; 
				keyboard, menu, and drag-and-drop file manipulations;
				automatic configurable program associations; trashbin with
				restore; file renaming; file property editing; and more!
				Less than 150 KB installed.
