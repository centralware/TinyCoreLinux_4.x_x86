Comments:       CouchDB is document database server. It is schema-free,
                distributed, ... It is not a relational database.

                To load it use:
                $ tce-load -i couchdb
                
                To start the database server:
                $ /etc/init.d/couchdb start
                
                To test it:
                $ curl 127.0.0.1:5984
                
                The paths to the configuration files being use are in this
                distribution are:
                /etc/default/couchdb
                /etc/couchdb/*
                /etc/init.d/couchdb
                
                Bear in mind that, by default, the database is created at:
                /usr/local/var/lib/couchdb
                
                This directory disappears when you reboot. You may wish to
                change that directory in the file:
                /etc/couchdb/default.ini
