                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		A. Installation Notes
		---------------------

		Python is required but not included as a dependency
		to allow for user version preferences.

		- python.tcz (ver. 2.6+) works as is without modification.

		- python-2.5.2.tcz requires a symlink to /usr/local/bin/python

		  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.5 /usr/local/bin/python

		- python-2.5.2-minimal.tcz does not work.



		B. Optional Extensions
		----------------------

		pyogg-vorbis.tcz  - required if you want to stream ogg-vorbis files
		tcp-wrappers.tcz - to filter network traffic



		C. Configuration
		----------------

		A config file is created during the initial install and placed in:

		   ~/.edna/edna.conf

		The only option which must be set prior to first use is the location
		of your mp3 directory in the [sources] section. (default: not set)

		Other options can be changed as well:

		1. The port number (default: 8080)
		2. User and password authentication (default: none)
		3. Logging options (default: standard out)
		4. Server customization and appearance

		Note: If you accidentally lose the config file in your home directory and
		don't have a backup, run the following command to create a new one:

		   sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/edna



		D. Running Edna
