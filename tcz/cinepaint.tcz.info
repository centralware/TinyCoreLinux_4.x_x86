Comments:       CinePaint has many useful features for photographers.
		It supports the editing of images with up to 32 bits per channel.
		It also supports colour management through the use of I.C.C. profiles.
		Please be aware that this is pre-release software which does contain bugs.
		When first run, it will say that the installation failed, but it seems fine.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
