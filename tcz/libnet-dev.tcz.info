Comments:       Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application
				programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides
				a portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet
				shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium
				of packet creation from the application programmer such as multiplexing,
				buffer management, arcane packet header information, byte-ordering,
				OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features portable packet
				creation interfaces at both the IP-layer and link-layer, as well as
				a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet,
				quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with
				little effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be written
				(Traceroute and Ping were easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap).
 
				The original libnet has become unmaintained at packetfactory.net, and
				it's original author is unreachable. This version was forked from the
				1.1.3 release candidate, then bug fixed, actively maintained, and rereleased.
