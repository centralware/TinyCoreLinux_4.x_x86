                This is a simple program that allows you to make dynamic
                tests and in real time.
                To save the file you need to export the code using the
                function in menu and save it to a text file.
                If you want to have access to our circuits from the program
                interface you can edit the file according to the tcontents of
                circuit pack-examples.tcz.
                You can also edit the executable in /usr/local/bin/circuit
                to keep your circuits in another directory, for example by
                starting the program from your home.
