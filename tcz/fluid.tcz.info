Comments:       The Fast Light User Interface Designer, or FLUID, 
		is a graphical editor that is used to produce FLTK 
		source code. FLUID edits and saves its state in .fl 
		files. These files are text, and you can (with care) 
		edit them in a text editor, perhaps to get some 
		special effects.
