                Extracts linux libflashplayer.so
                Setup libflashplayer for either Minefield, Firefox, Opera, 
		Seamonkey or all four. Also includes compiled libflashsupport.so 
		for OSS sound. libflashsupport is licensed under Creative 
		Commons Attribution 3.0.
                Finally packages a flash11.tcz to add to your tcz collection.
.
                NOTE:  Upon first time loading of this extension, the getflash11.sh
		script is automatically run.  Later, if you want to update your flash11.tcz,
		then select getFlash11 from the Apps menu and run it, following the directions
		given about rebooting.
.
                If you already have your tce directory setup, then a flash11.tcz
                will be installed there, otherwise it is in /tmp/tce/.  flash11.tcz
		will be loaded upon completion of the getflash script.
.
                CAUTION: Flash11 requires gtk2 which is quite large.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
