Comments:       Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL
                standard features that runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety
                of Unix platforms. Firebird offers excellent concurrency,
                high performance, and powerful language support for stored
                procedures and triggers. It has been used in production
                systems, under a variety of names, since 1981.

                Firebird root directory is /usr/local/etc/firebird-2.5-super.
                To run multiple instances of Firebird, you have to copy this
                directory to a new location and make a new init.d script out of
                /etc/init.d/firebird-2.5-super and set FIREBIRD in it to point
                to this location. In addition to that, you'll have to make a
                copy of /var/lib/firebird-2.5/security2.fdb and change the
                symlink in your new firebird root directory to point to it.

                Server binaries only.
                Client tools like gbak etc. are in firebird-2.5-tools.tcz!

                This extension is PPI compatible.
