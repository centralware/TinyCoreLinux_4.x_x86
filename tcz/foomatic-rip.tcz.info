Comments:       Contains foomatic-rip and beh (Backend Error Handler). 
		foomatic-rip is the main PostScript/PDF-to-printer's-native-language 
		filter and beh is a CUPS backend wrapper for fine-tuning how a CUPS 
		queue should behave on failure of its backend.

		foomatic-rip (executable) works with all spoolers and always uses PPD files 
		for printer/driver capabilities info. Manufacturer-supplied PPDs (in most
		cases of PostScript printers) can be used, too. For getting Foomatic PPD 
		files for this version, go to http://www.openprinting.org/

		foomatic-rip.tcz could be called Filter scripts as this tcz can be used by the 
		printer spoolers to convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's 
		native format using a printer/driver specific, but spooler-independent PPD file.
		
		Some dependencies not in depends are:              
		For beh: perl5
		For some printers you may need libgs or ghostscript_common or ghostscript
		see text doc called USAGE
	
		Built for TC 4.x.............. Night build is roughly version 4.0.17
