Comments:       This extension is PPI compatible, and self contained in
		/usr/local/bochs-2.3.7-i486.  It is built specifically to 
		emulate an i486 DX processor, mostly useful for testing 
		i486 compatibility of iso's or apps.  

		Being self contained, it will not interfere with
		other bochs extensions.  It is provided with a default
		config file that will boot a cdrom, though easily edited
		to boot an iso image on the hard drive.  The file used is
		/usr/local/bochs-2.3.7-i486/share/bochs/bochsrc.  Edit and
		back up this file if desired.  There is also the much larger
		and complex default upstream config file that requires 
		editing to function, found in the same directory called 
		bochsrc-upstream.  

		To toggle mouse, use ctrl/middle-mouse-button.

		Basically, pop in a cdrom in your /dev/hdc drive and load 
		bochs from the menu entry and it should work. 

		Compile options:
		./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bochs-2.3.7-i486 --enable-cpu-level=4
		--enable-plugins --with-all-libs --enable-pci --enable-usb 
		--build=i486-pc-linux-gnu --enable-ne2000 --enable-sb16=linux --enable-vbe
