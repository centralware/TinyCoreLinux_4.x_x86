Comments:       iperf3 is NOT backwards compatible with the original iperf 2.x. It is a new implementation 
		from scratch, with the goal of a smaller, simpler code base, and a library version of the 
		functionality that can be used in other programs. Iperf3 also a number of features found in 
		other tools such as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing from iperf2.x.
