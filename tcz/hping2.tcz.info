Comments:       hping2 is an interactive packet costructor and responses analyzer that uses 
                the same CLI of the ping program (but with a lot of extensions). It can be 
                used to performs a lot of tasks, like testing of firewall rules, (spoofed) 
                port scanning, et cetera.
