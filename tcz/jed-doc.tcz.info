Comments:	JED is a freely available multiplatform text editor. Although
		it is a powerful editor designed for use by programmers, its
		drop-down menu facility make it one of the friendliest text
		editors around. Hence it is ideal for composing simple email
		messages as well as editing complex programs in a variety of
		computer languages.
