                	Since Opera has a low-ram mode where e-mail,
                	IRC, and RSS functionality is removed, and
                	because it's primarily a browser, the icon
                	launches this low-ram mode. Both are available
                	in the menu.
			Also works with flash if gtk2.scm and getFlash11.scm
			are used.
			Contains:
			expat -		version 2.0.1
			fontconfig - 	version 2.8.0
