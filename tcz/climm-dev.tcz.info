Comments:	climm was initially a text based ICQ client supporting many of the
		ICQ features provided by the client by Mirabilis. It supports
		password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts, searching,
		file transfer, acknowledged messages, SMS, client identification,
		logging, scripting, transcoding, multi-UIN usage and other features
		that makes it a very complete yet simple tinternationalized client
		supporting the current ICQ v8 protocol.
		It now also supports the XMPP protocol as well as OTR encrypted
		messages.
		It has leading support for (ICQ2002+/ICQ Lite/ICQ2go) unicode
		encoded messages unreached by other ICQ clones.
		A lot of other ICQ clients are based in spirit on climm,
		nevertheless climm is still _the_ console based ICQ client.
