Comments:       This is the old, Iperf 2 code base. The primary development has moved to Iperf 3 which is 
		hosted on Google Code  http://code.google.com/p/iperf/.
		Iperf was developed by NLANR/DAST as a modern alternative for measuring maximum TCP and UDP 
		bandwidth performance. Iperf allows the tuning of various parameters and UDP characteristics.
		Iperf reports bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss.
