Comments:       A very fast network logon cracker which support many different services.

                Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password security study shows.
                Hydra is a parallized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. New modules
                are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and very fast.

                Currently this tool supports:
                 TELNET, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP-PROXY, SMB, SMBNT, MS-SQL, MYSQL, REXEC,
                 RSH, RLOGIN, CVS, SNMP, SMTP-AUTH, SOCKS5, VNC, POP3, IMAP, NNTP, PCNFS,
                 ICQ, SAP/R3, LDAP2, LDAP3, Postgres, Teamspeak, Cisco auth, Cisco enable,
                 AFP, LDAP2, Cisco AAA (incorporated in telnet module).

                This tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security
                consultants the possiblity to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized
                access from remote to a system.

                Usage examples:
                 hydra -L userlist -P password 192.168.0.1 smb
                 hydra -L userlist -P password ftp.example.com ftp -f
                 cat dictionary.txt | pw-inspector -m 6 -c 2 -n > passlist.txt
