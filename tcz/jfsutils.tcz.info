Comments:       JFS is a journaling file system from IBM.
		Before coming to Linux it was used in OS/2 for a decade.
-
		It is known for the lowest CPU usage of all journaling 
		file systems, occasionally even lower than ext2.
-
		The support for mounting JFS can be found in
		the filesystems extension.
