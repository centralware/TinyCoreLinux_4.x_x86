Comments:       man page and config for dwm. 
                diff from stock config:  font, bottom bar, "Gimp-2.6" rule & no Firefox rule.
                suggestions for a more sensible basic config taken @forum or by PM,
                but if you want to pimp it out - you're gonna have to pack your own.
