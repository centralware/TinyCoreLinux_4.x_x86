Comments:       GNU Common C++ is a portable and highly optimized class 
framework for writing C++ applications that need to use threads and 
support concurrent sychronization, and that use sockets, XML parsing, 
serialization, config files, thread-optimized String and data structure 
classes, etc. This framework offers a class foundation that hides 
platform differences from your C++ application so that you need not 
write platform specific code. GNU Common C++ has been ported to compile 
nativily on most platforms which support either posix threads, or on 
Microsoft Windows. GNU Common C++ can also be used to construct embedded 
applications as part of GNU Telephony Open Embedded.
This framework is used to construct application services like GNU 
Bayonne, as well as part of additional libraries such as the GNU Common 
C++ RTP Stack and the GNU ccScript engine. Other libraries related to 
GNU Common C++ include the stand-alone GNU_ccAudio2 framework
