Comments:       From http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/:

                  Chrony is a pair of programs which are used to
                  maintain the accuracy of the system clock on a
                  computer. The two programs are called chronyd and
                  chronyc.

                  Chronyd is a daemon which runs in background on the
                  system. It obtains measurements via the network of
                  the system clock's offset relative to time servers
                  on other systems and adjusts the system time
                  accordingly. For isolated systems, the user can
                  periodically enter the correct time by hand (using
                  Chronyc). In either case, Chronyd determines the
                  rate at which the computer gains or loses time, and
                  compensates for this. Chronyd implements the NTP
                  protocol and can act as either a client or a server.

                  Chronyc provides a user interface to Chronyd for
                  monitoring its performance and configuring various
                  settings. It can do so while running on the same
                  computer as the Chronyd instance it is controlling
                  or a different computer.

                This extension was built from 

                  http://download.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony-1.26.tar.gz

                The chrony manual is

                  http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html

                The chrony configuration file for this extension is 

                  /usr/local/etc/chrony/chrony.conf

                It should work without modification for any system
                that has good network connectivity when the system
                starts.  Execute

                  sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/chrony restart

                to restart chrony if the network goes down or if
                chrony does not seem to be synchronizing the clock.
                The default configuration does not save any system
                state on disk.  Chrony will generally synchronize the
                system clock within a few minutes.

                The default configuration synchronizes with four
                servers from the pool provided by pool.ntp.org; see
                http://www.pool.ntp.org for suggestions about
                selecting more appropriate servers.

                The default configuration tests the accuracy of the
                system clock whenever chrony starts execution.  If the
                clock is in error by more than 30 seconds, the clock
                is set immediately to the correct time. Otherwise, the
                clock is slewed (adjusted) incrementally in such a
                manner that time never jumps backward.

                Execute 

                  echo -e 'tracking\n sources -v' | chronyc 

                to get an overview of the state of chronyd.

                Critical chronyc commands are protected by a password
                that is stored in

                  /usr/local/etc/chrony/chrony.keys

                The default password is "mc". For example, execute

                  echo -e 'password mc\n burst 5/10' | chronyc 

                to cause chronyd to attempt to get 5 good responses 
                quickly for each ntp server but to send no more than
                10 requests to each server.  This command can speed
                up synchronization.
