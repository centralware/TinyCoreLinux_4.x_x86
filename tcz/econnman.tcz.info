Comments:	connmand needs to be running, please read connman1 info file.
		Executing econnman without arguments will start it WITHOUT the agent
		support. Any requested interaction will be left to existing agents, if
		any. This means that if you need to input passwords, it will use
		another agent.

		If you do not have another agent and need to type in passwords, then
		start econnman with the agent support:
		
		        econnman-bin --agent
		
		Extensions build system is tc-ext-tools
