Comments:	----------------------------------------------
		You need Java. Tested with sun-jre.tcz
		
		Kangee is an easy-to-use personal on-demand
		fileserver, enabling you to exchange files with
		your friends. Your communication partner only
		needs a browser to download or upload files to
		you.
		Unlike one-click hosting services, Kangee will not
		store files on any remote machine, instead, you
		will become your own one-click hoster. 
		
		For Kangee, a type of Internet access is needed
		that supports incoming connections, like many
		ADSL/Cable providers do. However, often mobile 3G
		internet access providers do not support this
		feature yet.

		This extension is PPI compatible.
