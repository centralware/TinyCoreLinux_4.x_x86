Comments:	In case e doesn't start, delete ~/.e and restart X, then make 
		your way through the initial config, then go to settings 
		panel -> look -> startup and uncheck show splash screen on 
		login.
	
		In case u use the wm shutdown/restart instead of the exit 
		tc gui the backup will be performed depending on the global
		tc BACKUP variable.
		optional deps: 
		   -e-modules-extra
		   -evas_generica_loaders
		   -evas_generic_loaders+librsvg for svg
		    (first way doesn't work for me)
		For a cannection manager load connman1 and optionally
		econnman
