Comments:       "dtach" allows a console application to be "detached"
	       	from the screen and associated with a file for later retrieval.
	        
	        Basic use is to start a CLI appliation with:
	        
	        dtach -c  /tmp/foo application (foo being whatever..)
	        example:"dtach -c /tmp/foo elinks"
	        You can then move on to something else with:
		(control backslash)
		Ctrl\  will return you to the CLI prompt.

	        Multiple programs can be "dtach"-ed to /tmp/foo1, etc. 
	        The dtach'd app can be recovered with
	        
	        dtach -a /tmp/foo  (multiples with foo1, etc)

		The app can be "brought back" at your original terminal,
		 or from  anywhere you can ssh into your machine.

		Useful in Microcore, works from Aterm in Tinycore, too.
