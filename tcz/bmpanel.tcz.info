Comments:	BMPanel (BitMap Panel) contains a desktop switcher, 
		taskbar, system tray, and clock. It can be themed by 
		executing 'bmpanel theme-name'. For more themes, install 
		the bmpanel-theme.tcz extension.
		
		NOTE: for full functionality, BMPanel *requires* a 
		NETWM/EWMH-compliant window manager, such as fluxbox, 
		openbox, and icewm. If all you see when you run it is 
		the panel and the clock, your window manager is very 
		likely not compliant.
