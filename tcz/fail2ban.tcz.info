Comments:       Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/pwdfail and bans IP
                that makes too many password failures. It updates firewall
                rules to reject the IP address. These rules can be defined by
                the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files.

                You can configure Fail2ban using the files in /usr/local/etc/fail2ban.
                It is possible to configure the server using commands sent to
                it by fail2ban-client. The available commands are described
                in the man page of fail2ban-client. Please refer to it or to
                the website: http://www.fail2ban.org

                Built with the following command:
                python setup.py build --verbose

                Fail2Ban is Python script so no compiling needed.

                You should edit the configuration files:
                 /usr/local/etc/fail2ban/

                Use the: 'fail2ban-client -d -c /usr/share/fail2ban' command to debug!
