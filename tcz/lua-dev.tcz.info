                  Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable 
                  scripting language.

		  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful
		  data description constructs based on associative
		  arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically
		  typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a
		  register-based virtual machine, and has automatic
		  memory management with incremental garbage collection,
		  making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
		  rapid prototyping.

                See http://www.lua.org/docs.html for documentation.

                This extension contains the developmental files that
                go with lua.tcz.  These files are needed to prepare a
                C or C++ module that can be loaded at run-time to 
                extend the Lua interpreter.
