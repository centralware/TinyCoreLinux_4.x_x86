Comments:       The Gutenprint package contains plug-and-play drivers for hundreds of printers. 
		It generates PPD files dynamically to save space on your hard drive. This allows
		printing only for some single or multifunction or all-in-ones printers. There are other tczs 
		that may offer PPDs. This tcz does not have the gimp plugin by compile design.

		"It is suggested that you have at least 64 MB of memory for general purpose printing, 
		256 MB or more for high quality printing on a good printer, and 1 GB or more for 
		large format printing at high resolution"

		Optional TCZ: gutenprint-ijs

		A 5.2.9 list of PPDs is here http://ompldr.org/vaHBocg/gutlist
		Pls consider using this list before deciding to download this package.
		There may be are other tczs in TC which offer PPDs for your printer?
  		  
                ** Note well for this UPGRADE ** (includes instructions for new users)
		We now use /usr/local 
		1) Before reboot, remove any gutenprint files and pathways from /opt/.filetool.lst
		2) Your old PPD may not be upgraded, but make a backup of it such as to usb stick.
		If new gutenprint does not have a PPD for you, see step (6)
		3) Reboot, load gutenprint then cups, turn on printer then start cups with
		$ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups restart ( a safer option)
		4) If you have no persistence for root password, create root password with $ sudo passwd
		5) Point web browser to http://localhost:631/admin -- Then click on Add printer (not find printer)
		Cups will then ask for root password....after you have, then redo the search for a PPD
		6) ## Only for those who did not find a PPD, copy your backup old PPD to /tmp and run
		$ sudo cups-genppdupdate -s /tmp -o /tmp
		in cups click on the PPD file option and point to /tmp
		7) All users, then click set the default after making any changes.

		To persist across boots, add to /opt/.filetool.lst
		##################################################
		usr/local/etc/cups/ppd/filename.ppd (Change filename to your specific name)
		usr/local/etc/cups/printer.conf (if you changed a setting)
		etc/passwd (if you like to keep root password)
		etc/shadow (ditto)

		If you print nearly every boot, consider adding 
		cups.tcz 
		gutenprint.tcz
		to your onboot.lst  If you do, then add the following to your bootlocal.sh
		/usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start

		Epson ink level can be found with
		$ escputil --ink-level --raw-device /dev/usb/lp0

		Please check other executables that are available and I recommend the gutenprint-doc.tcz on 
		their use or further tips on how to use this package.
