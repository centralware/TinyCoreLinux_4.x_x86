Comments:       FbTerm is a fast terminal emulator for linux with frame buffer device. Features include: 
                * mostly as fast as terminal of linux kernel while accelerated scrolling is enabled on framebuffer device
                * select font with fontconfig and draw text with freetype2, same as Qt/Gtk+ based GUI apps
                * dynamicly create/destroy up to 10 windows initially running default shell
                * record scrollback history for every window
                * auto-detect current locale and convert text encoding, support double width scripts like Chinese, Japanese etc
                * switch between configurable additional text encodings with hot keys on the fly
                * copy/past selected text between windows with mouse when gpm server is running
                * change the orientation of screen display, a.k.a. screen rotation
                * lightweight input method framework with client-server architecture
                * background image for eye candy

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
                Built with the following options:
                ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

                Check whether accelerated scrolling is enabled or not:
                 fbterm -v -> The message with: "scrolling: redraw" means fast scrolling is disabled, otherwise enabled.

                To start FbTerm with a custom font for example:
                 fbterm --font-names="Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" --font-height=16
                 (You need the ttf-bitstream-vera.tcz extension for this font)

                Note: You will need Xlibs.gz if you are using MicroCore.
