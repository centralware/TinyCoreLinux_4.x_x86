Comments:       This extension is installed self contained in 
		/usr/local/audacity.  This extension also contains
		wxgtk-2.4.2 inside /usr/local/audacity/lib as it is 
		an older wxgtk library compiled specifically for 
		audacity that may otherwise conflict with the more c
		current wxgtk offerings in the extension repo if 
		installed in the usual manner in /usr/local/lib.  
		Install alsa or OSS for sound.
