Comments:	The conntrack-tools are a set of tools targeted at system
		administrators. They are conntrack, the userspace command
		line interface, and conntrackd, the userspace daemon. The
		tool conntrack provides a full featured interface that is
		intended to replace the old /proc/net/ip_conntrack
		interface. Using conntrack, you can view and manage the
		in-kernel connection tracking state table from userspace.
		On the other hand, conntrackd covers the specific aspects
		of stateful firewalls to enable highly available scenarios,
		and can be used as statistics collector as well.

		Enter  sudo conntrack -E  then generate some network
		traffic and watch for a response.

		Available man files: conntrack, conntrackd, and nfct
