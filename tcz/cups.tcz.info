Comments:       Optional TCZs: gutenprint, hplip* foomatic* or other PPD tczs as you need a 
		PPD which acts like a printer driver. HP users can check hplip via
		http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/supported_devices/index.html
		HP on non-HP users can try
		http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/p_Supported_Printers.php
		This reveals gutenprint PPDs and their foomatic names. foomatic-db not yet submitted.

		For possible detection of remote printers independent cups-filters "may" have 
		TCZ=cups-browsed.tcz. Search APPS for other cups related packages. CUPS can not be 
		used for scanning.

		Wireless users--- avahi.tcz has not been made a dependency but libavahi has.
		Shared with windows users-- samba3.tcz has not been made a dependency. 

		** Upgraders ** cupsd.conf has split into cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf
		Before reboot remove all persistence except for your PPD file.
		Full reboot required after upgrade. Then follow below How-to please.
		*** If you make changes to your cupsd.conf run the test, $ sudo cupsd -t

		** For CUPS 1.6.x a bug report/feature request is posted to ask for removal of bannertops:
		** http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120 ( a Message from the cups-filters team)
		see the doc INSTALL for cups-filters, if interested.

		I have kept the security setting as Basic. You may wish to load the cups-doc and 
		read the security docs. You can search through the cups page, Online Help
		setting=Basic broadcasts password in clear text.

		Some network users may need to create (using root powers) /usr/local/etc/cups/client.conf
		Contents are: ServerName server-ip
		Where server-ip would be replaced by the local IP address of the CUPS server on the network.
		Config is case sensitive, meaning watch out for ServerName. Most printers have different 
		settings pls read http://localhost:631/help/network.html
		
		How-to Print 
		************
                * Create a root password unless you already have one saved with
		   ----- $ sudo passwd 
		* Start cups daemon              $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start
		* (Optional for wireless users)  $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/avahi start
		* (Optional for bluetooth users) $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/bluez start
                * Open a web browser to page http://localhost:631/admin (<--- TIP bookmark this)
		* Click on add printer so that CUPS brings up the CUPS for root password input box 
		  -----NOTE CUPS uses your root password only for this session
		  ----- unless you follow persistence tips.
		* Follow the prompts to select a PPD thru some package or a saved PPD

		To persist across boots-----See also cups-filters if you use cups-browsed.
		*********************** add the following to your backup:
		usr/local/etc/cups/ppd/
                usr/local/etc/cups/printers.conf
                usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf      (only if you changed it)
		usr/local/etc/cups/cups-files.conf (only if you changed it)
		usr/local/etc/cups/snmp.conf       (only if you changed it)
		usr/local/etc/pam.d/cups	   (only if you changed it)	
                etc/shadow                         (if you want to save root password)

		CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple
    		Inc. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") and provides command-line 
		interfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and print jobs.  
		It supports printing to both local (parallel, serial, USB) and networked printers, and 
		printers can be shared from one computer to another, even over the Internet!
		Built with the cups usb backend (not the libusb backend)

		** The following are NOT bugs but build features to allow tce-load without complaining 
		about special permissions, if you turn on debug mode you will see CUPS do the following:
		* Repairing access permissions of "/usr/local/etc/cups/ssl" needs to be 700
		* Repairing access permissions of "/var/spool/cups" --------needs to be 710
		AFAIK tce-load does not like group without write permission.
