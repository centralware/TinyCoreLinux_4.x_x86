Comments:	Frescobaldi is a python-qt4-based integrated editor for
		LilyPond notation files. It uses pyPortMidi for MIDI
		playback and navigation, and python-poppler-qt4 to display
		and manage PDF views.
		
		Frescobaldi requires no build. This extension was created
		using the included installer:
		python setup.py install --prefix=/your/target/dir
				
		Tested on TC4.6 with ALSA and:
		python-2.7	
		lilypond-2.12.2
		poppler 0.20.0
		libportmidi src-200
		fluidsynth 1.1.5
