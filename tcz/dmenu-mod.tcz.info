		Type dmenu_run. Further info: http://man.suckless.org/tools/1/dmenu
		
		I modified dmenu_path thus dmenu's behaviour changed:
		First create your cache file that will hold your menu items. touch ~/.dmenu_cache
		Open the file with your favourite text editor and add the desired application names i.e.:
		appbrowser
		cpanel
		etc.
		You have to manually add menu items to your .dmenu_cache and only those items will be displayed.
		Note that if you enter a valid application name which isn't part of your cache file the 
		application will start regardless. So if you don't use firefox too often you don't have to add
		it to your dmenu_cache file. Just run dmenu then type firefox and press enter.
		My config with openbox (put this in your rc.xml file's keyboard section): 
			<keybind key=A-space>
				<action name=Execute>
					<command>dmenu_run -nb '#E50000' -nf '#000000' -sb '#a6b38d' -sf '#070806'</command>
				</action>
			</keybind>
		When you are done reconfigure your openbox (openbox --reconfigure) and press Alt+Space. Enjoy.
