Comments:       Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat.
                Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra features,
                more counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems
                during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting. 

                Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources in real-time,
                you can eg. compare disk utilization in combination with interrupts
                from your IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers
                directly with the disk throughput (in the same interval).

                Dstat gives you detailed selective information in columns and clearly
                indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed. Less
                confusion, less mistakes. And most importantly, it makes it very easy
                to write plugins to collect your own counters.

                Dstat's output by default is designed for being interpreted by humans
                in real-time, however you can export details to CSV output to a file
                to be imported later into Gnumeric or Excel to generate graphs.

                Dstat is Python script so no compiling needed.
