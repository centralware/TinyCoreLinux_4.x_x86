                http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R14B_erts-5.8.1.1.tar.gz

                It does not support:
                - jinterface: no Java compiler found.
                - odbc: ODBC library - link check failed
                - wx: exWidgets not found, wx will NOT be usable.
                - documentation: not built (xsltproc and fop missing).
                
                Compiled using openssl-0.9.8-dev. OpenSSL might be affected by
                patent licenses (read its documentation). Distribution of
                cryptographic software maybe regulated in some countries.
