Comments:       CUPS upstream has split into cups (Apple) and cups-filters.
		
		Contains filters and software developed independently 
		of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing workflow 
		introduced by OpenPrinting. The cups-browsed daemon has been split 
		off to its own tcz for possible remote printer detection. 
		
		So optional TCZ is cups-browsed.tcz
