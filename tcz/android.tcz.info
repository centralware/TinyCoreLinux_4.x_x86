Comments:       This package contains adb for shelling into your Android device, 
		as well as Heimdall for flashing.
		I personally have not made any of the binaries, but they seem to 
		work out-of-box for my device OK.

		Note: heimdall-frontend requires dependency "qt-4.x-xml.tcz", and
		 the question mark "help" buttons don't seem to work right.

		You CAN soft-brick your device if you use Heimdall incorrectly. 
		Please read, re-read, and read out loud the instructions VERY 
		carefully before attempting to use an unfamiliar tool. Heimdall is 
		THAT powerful.

Change-log:     2012/08/08 Initial package. Heimdall Version 1.3.2
Current:        2012/08/08
