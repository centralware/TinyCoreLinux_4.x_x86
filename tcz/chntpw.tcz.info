Comments:       This little program will enable you to view some information and
                change user passwords in a Windows NT SAM userdatabase file.
                You do not need to know the old passwords.
                However, you need to get at the file some way or another yourself.
                In addition it contains a simple registry editor with full write support,
                and hex-editor which enables you to
                fiddle around with bits&bytes in the file as you wish yourself. 
                Needs openssl-0.9.8h.tcz for proper work.
