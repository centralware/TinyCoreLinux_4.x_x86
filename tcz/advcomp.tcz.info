-
		Advdef and advzip of AdvanceComp included. They
		are used to repack zlib streams using an improved
		algorithm, saving space. This does not affect decompression.
-
		Advdef handles png, and anything gzipped (tgz, svgz..)
		Advzip handles zip files.
-
		With png files the usual saving is about 20%, with gzipped
		files about 10%.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
