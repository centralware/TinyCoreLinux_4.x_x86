Comments:	----------------------------------------------
		You need Java. Tested with sun-jre.tcz
		
		Jarnal able to notetaking (with primitive
		handwriting recognition), sketching, keeping a
		journal, making a presentation, annotating a
		document - including pdf - or collaborating using
		a stylus, mouse or keyboard.
		
		Package includes three executable:
		jarnal (standard version)
		jarnalannotate (with separate template settings)
		jarnalmini (mini interface, but i think this not
		work well, it's is better use this integrated
		within the standard version.)
		
		Change default template is possible using menÃ¹:
		File-->Options-->Edit Current Template and save
		changes, of course you must add to .filetool.lst
		the voice usr/local/share/Jarnal/templates .
