Comments:       default configuration files and man page for euclid-wm.tcz
                copy to euclid-wm.conf and euclidrc into ~/.config/euclid-wm
                
                this wm is keyboard-driven so
                some sensible default keybindings have been given for apps
                found in a fresh _tinycore_ install, edit euclid-wm.conf to suit.
                alt-shift-Enter  xterm(terminal)
                alt-shift-Delete exittc(shutdown dialog)
                alt-E            editor
                alt-R            appbrowser(repository)

                alt-X            cpanel(xtrlpanel)       
                
                read manual page or conf file for more default keybindings
