Comments:       This is a custom build of Firefox..
                Depends on gtk2 and it's deps.  This extension
		conflicts with Minefield and Shiretoko but not the 
		official Firefox extension.
		----
		Warning:  This build of Firefox is provided for those
		with modest hardware and is intended for casual 
		web surfing.  There is some risk to using an 
		older version of a web browser that is no longer 
		maintained.  You may want to do your banking, online
		purchasing, and so on with a current web browser.
Change-log:     ----
