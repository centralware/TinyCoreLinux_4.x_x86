Comments:       D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator) is a platform capable to produce
		traffic at packet level accurately replicating appropriate stochastic processes 
		for both IDT (Inter Departure Time) and PS (Packet Size) random variables
		(exponential, uniform, cauchy, normal, pareto, ...). 
		D-ITG supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic generation and it is capable to generate 
		traffic at network, transport, and application layer.
