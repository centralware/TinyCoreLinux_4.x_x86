                ----------
                Note the handbrake build system does not (easily) allow using the usual
                tc cflags/cxxflags, which possibly means it will not work on some machines
                Note also the handbrake build system insists on statically linking some deps
                rather than using the system libs, which results in bloat and duplication
                ----------
