Comments:       pepper is the common name for libpepflashplayer.so 

		The desktop entry or the command pepper will, if consent granted,
		run the TC chromium-browser and offer an alternative flash plugin to		
		Adobe's.

		To check when you need to run this script again, if you like it,
		I suggest you bookmark
		http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/

		This plugin starts at 11.7.700.169 while it is rumoured 
		Adobe's will not exceed 11.2.202.280 

		The get script will download large files, then create the tcz.
		
		The local TC user may attempt to run pepper, before consenting but 
		it will provide an error message informing you to consent to the EULA.

		Be aware of the total downloads, you may already have some. 
		Totals are rounded to nearest M
		58M chromium-browser.tcz
		38M Debian file
		4M  submitqc4.tcz 
		3M wget.tcz + coreutils.tcz
		1M xz.tcz + dkpg-deb.tcz 

		If you wish to use persistence, add pepper.tcz to your
		onboot.lst and remove chromium-browser.tcz 

		If you wish to view the EULA before running this script see
		http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_text.html

		To run the script use root powers via
		sudo sh /usr/local/bin/get-pepper.sh
