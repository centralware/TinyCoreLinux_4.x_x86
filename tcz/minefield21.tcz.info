Comments:       This is the unbranded build based on Mozilla technology built from source. 
		This extension is not designed to load with other Mozilla family browsers 
		already loaded. If you elect to have 2 or more mozilla browsers downloaded 
		then run one per boot.

		Each major release gets a new minefieldnn.tcz where nn = major release number
		check the changelog in the info file for minor release numbers.

		Be aware that loading a plugin for one browser "made" it available for the other
		on reboot, due to /home/tc/.mozilla, which keeps all mozilla configs in one folder
