Comments:	Liboil is a library of simple functions that 
		are optimized for various CPUs. These functions 
		are generally loops implementing simple algorithms, 
		such as converting an array of N integers to 
		floating-point numbers or multiplying and summing 
		an array of N numbers. Such functions are candidates 
		for significant optimization using various techniques, 
		especially by using extended instructions provided 
		by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
