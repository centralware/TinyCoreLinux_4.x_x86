                --------
                In CUPS, add your Windows printer as smb://PCNAME/PRINTERNAME
                --------
                Find PCNAME under Control Panel > System > Computer Name > Full name
                --------
                PRINTERNAME is the one-word identifier assigned by Windows. Find it
                under the Sharing tab of the printer's properties. If PRINTERNAME
                contains spaces, replace them with the code %20 in CUPS.
                --------
                If your PC requires authentication, try 
                    smb://USER:PASSWORD@WORKGROUP/PCNAME/PRINTERNAME
                --------
                You may need to modify your PC's firewall or security software to 
                allow network printing.
