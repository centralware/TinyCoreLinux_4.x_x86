Comments:       Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side
                application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it
                can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its
                network protocol.
                
                CONFIGURATION
                -------------
                This version comes without any pre-configuration. Only a 
                sample configuration file is available.
                
                Copy example configuration
                  tce-load -i mpd-doc
                  sudo cp /usr/local/share/doc/mpd/mpdconf.example /etc/mpd.conf
                Modify (with sudo) /etc/mpd.conf according to your requirements.
                The required directories must be created if necessary.
                Put mpd.conf in your backup if /etc is not persistent
                  echo "etc/mpd.conf" >> /opt/.filetool.lst

                START mpd
                ---------
                sudo /usr/local/bin/mpd /etc/mpd.conf
                Save this (without sudo) in your /opt/bootlocal.sh if mpd should
                be started automatically at boot time.
                
                STOP mpd
                --------
                sudo killall mpd
