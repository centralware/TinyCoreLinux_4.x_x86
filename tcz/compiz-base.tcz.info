Comments:       This is OpenGL Desktop based on compiz.

		Before proceeding you need to setup hardware accelerated GLX (i.e. nvidia-glx, ati-fglrx)
		if you don't have it already.

		Installation:
		1-) Install gconf schemas:
			sudo update-gconf-database register-all
		2-) Add to backup (/opt/.filetool.lst)
			usr/local/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml

		I have setup compiz with some plugins loaded by default
		and intentionally left all remaining plugin selection to you.

		You can select plugins with compizconfig settings manager (ccsm).

		My plugin recommendations:
		---------------------------------------
		Rotate Cube or Wall
		Ring Switcher or Shift Switcher
		Expo
		---------------------------------------

		Important note: Keybindings may not be working when you are just logged into X session.
		Restarting window manager solves this issue. You can restart compiz by executing the command "compiz".

		This extension requires Xorg.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
