Comments:       ----------------------------------------------------
		Create a mountpoint in your home directory. Then
                mount the IDE64 disk drive device or disk image file

		Usage:

		Mount: cfs11mount /dev/wholedisk /mount/point
		Unmount: fusermount -u /mount/point

		Differences from IDEDOS:
		- This driver fragments the filesystem quite a lot during
		  parallel file write
		- Also this driver has no fragmentation avoidance built in
		- Special C64 filenames will create invalid UTF-8 sequences

		No waranty that this works. Use it on your own risk.
