Comments:       mtPaint's console version. Has almost all of the 
		functionality of mtPaint.
-
		It's somewhere between netpbm and imagemagick, in that 
		it's a single app, and in functionality.
-
		Example, convert all jpegs to pngs, while scaling them 
		to width 800, keeping aspect ratio, and using 
		Blackman-Harris scaling:
		mtpaint-cli -scalew 800 *jpeg
