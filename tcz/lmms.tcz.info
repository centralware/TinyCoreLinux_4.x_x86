Comments:       configure warnings:
	 = You don't seem to have JACK-library installed and/or JACK-lib-development-
	 = package is missing. This will disable support for JACK-transport.
	 = This is no problem but you'll miss the great possibilities of interacting
	 = with other sound-applications in realtime!
	 = Consider installing the missing packages for using the full power of LMMS.
	 =
	 = You don't seem to have SDL_sound-library installed and/or SDL_sound-
	 = development-package is missing. This means that you can only load samples
	 = within LMMS if you have libsndfile and libvorbis installed!
	 = Consider installing the missing packages for using the full power of LMMS.
	 =
	 = As the header file ladspa.h could not be found on your system, a version
	 = shipped with LMMS will be used. This is no problem at all but generally
	 = it's better to use files being customized to your system/distribution.
	 = If you encounter problems related to LADSPA-support, try to install
	 = LADSPA-SDK-package (ladspa-sdk, ladspa-dev or similiar) and run configure
	 = again.
	 =
	 = You don't seem to have STK installed and/or STK-development-package
	 = (Debian/Ubuntu: libstk0-dev) is missing. Without this package, the 
	 = STK instrument plugins ("Mallets") won't be built.
	 = Consider installing the missing packages for using the full power of LMMS.
	 =
	 = You don't seem to have Festival development files.
	 = The SingerBot instrument plugin will be ignored.
	 = Before enabling this plugin, bear in mind that it is still experimental.
	 =
 	 = You don't seem to have installed WINE or it's development-packages (headers,
	 = winegcc etc.) which are neccessary for building LMMS with built-in
	 = VST-support.
	 = If you do not intend to use VST-plugins with LMMS you can ignore this 
	 = warning.
	 = Consider installing the missing packages (Debian: libwine-dev,
	 = Ubuntu: wine-dev, openSUSE: wine-devel) for using the full power of LMMS.

	        * ALSA for audio- and MIDI-input/output
	        * OSS for audio- and MIDI-input/output
	        * SDL for audio-output
