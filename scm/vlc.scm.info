Comments:		VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player supporting most audio 
				and video formats (H.264, Ogg, DivX, MKV, TS, MPEG-2, mp3, MPEG-4, aac, ...) 
				from files, physical media (DVDs, VCD, Audio-CD), TV capture cards and many 
				network streaming protocols.
		
				Almost all audio and video codecs supported by this build except rare ones.
		
				Reading dvd (with menu support via libdvdnav),vcd,audio-cd, bd, TV capture cards enabled.

				To increase performance when playing hd movies:
				Tools->Preferences, in bottom left corner click on All for Show settings then
				Input/Codecs->Access modules->File, set Caching value to 800 ms or higher.
				Input/Codecs->Other codecs->FFmpeg->Decoding->Skip the loop filter for H.264 , select All

				VLC supports skins at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php
				Put the ones you like in the directory ~/.local/share/vlc/skins2
				To switch to skins ui: Tools->Preferences->Interface->Type then select Skins, and restart vlc.
				To change skin: Right click menu->Interface->Select skin.
				To directly load a skin file: Tools->Preferences->Interface->Interface Type->Skins menu.

				You need OSS, ALSA or PULSEAUDIO for sound.
