Tags:		LyX is a document processor.
Comments:	LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of 
		use of a graphical interface. LyX needs a full TeX distribution to generate 
		DVI,PDF,PS outputs. A full Tex Live installation takes about 2G disk space. 
		So instead of an installation use iso/DVD option. 

		To summarize things to do:
		1) Download texlive20xx.iso from http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html
		2) Burn it with a DVD or Mount texlive20xx.iso
		4) cd to DVD/iso root and Run tl-portable
		5) Run lyx in the same terminal
		6) Tools->Reconfigure
		7) Restart LyX

		LyX needs more than Tex Live for full functionality. Here are some suggested extensions:
		Image converter --> ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick
		Spell checker --> ispell, aspell, hunspell
		DVI viewer --> xdvi (available with TeX Live)
		PDF viewer --> xpdf, epdfview, gsview, evince, okular, foxit, adobe acrobat
		PS viewer --> gsview, evince, okular

		For more information see:
		http://www.lyx.org/AdditionalSoftware

		Note: Installing these programs is not enough usually. You have to specify
		appropriate commands to invoke them in Tools->Preferences
		
		For example if you installed GraphicsMagick as image converter
		Go to Tools->Preferences->File Handling->Converters
		add from PNG format to EPS format with command 'gm convert $$i $$o'
		For file viewers, Tools->Preferences->File Handling->File formats 
		Choose a file format and type correct program name inside textbox 'Viewer'
