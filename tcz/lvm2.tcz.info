Tags:		lvm2 Logical volume manager Linux
Comments:	Included dmsetup. Depends on liblvm2.tcz, raid-dm-2.6.33.3-tinycore.tcz modules and readline.tcz.
		After loading edit /usr/local/etc/lvm/lvm.conf to your needs and add to backup. Do the same with
		the udev rules files - but neither is really necessary since all the files are loaded with
		the extension.
