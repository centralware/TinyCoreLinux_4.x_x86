Comments:       From http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/:

                  Chrony is a pair of programs which are used to
                  maintain the accuracy of the system clock on a
                  computer. The two programs are called chronyd and
                  chronyc.

                  Chronyd is a daemon which runs in background on the
                  system. It obtains measurements via the network of
                  the system clock's offset relative to time servers
                  on other systems and adjusts the system time
                  accordingly. For isolated systems, the user can
                  periodically enter the correct time by hand (using
                  Chronyc). In either case, Chronyd determines the
                  rate at which the computer gains or loses time, and
                  compensates for this. Chronyd implements the NTP
                  protocol and can act as either a client or a server.

                  Chronyc provides a user interface to Chronyd for
                  monitoring its performance and configuring various
                  settings. It can do so while running on the same
                  computer as the Chronyd instance it is controlling
                  or a different computer.
